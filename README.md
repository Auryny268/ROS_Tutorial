# Robotics Coding Tutorial
In this repo, you will learn the basics of ROS2 and robotics fundamentals. The goal of this tutorial is start with the basics and slowly progress to creating your own full autonomy stack for the stinger tugs. Throughout this tutorial, you will fill out code blocks, answer questions, and write code. After completing each section, there will be a provided autograder that will verify your work. Only by passing all the required autograder tests should you move onto the next section. 

## Prerequisites
- **Some base knowledge of coding/python** If you are not yet familiar with python, you can still attempt to go through this onboarding process but it is highly recommended that you learn python first. Some great tutorials are:
  - https://www.w3schools.com/python/
  - https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
- Access to your MRG Cluster Virtual Machine
- Basics of Navigating Linux
